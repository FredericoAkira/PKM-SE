Steps to load the project file to your computer:
1. open xampp, start apache and mysql server.
2. open phpmyadmin, create a new database called "projectse", import its contents from a file called "projectse.sql".
3. create a new folder to hold all the files in "c > xampp > htdocs".
Here you can't use the live server extension from VScode, so instead you have to do it manually, just type in the browser "localhost/name_of_the_folder_you_created/file_you_want_to_open", for example "localhost/projectSE/views/landingPage.html".
If you've done all of the above you can use the website.
